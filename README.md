# bioSignals-LD

## 1. Introduction

`bioSignals-LD` was developed as a part of Intelligent Worker Assistance Application Area of the P2CODE Project. 

This repo represents the main application of the Use case 1 the app has the following functionalities. 

- create and initialize a trial from a simple web interface,
- provision a sensor through the FIWARE IoT Agent,
- compute frequency-domain features and derive fatigue-related states,
- trigger a complex-event-processing (CEP) workflow that publishes an updated robot cell state based on the fatigue state of the operator.

## 2. Archetecture
The Application based around Key FIWARE components namely Orion-LD , Mintaka and IoTAgent-JSON. 
The picture below depicts the overall Archetecture.

## 2. How to use the code

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danish123117/bioSignals-LD.git
cd bioSignals-LD
```

### Configure environment variables

The repository already includes a `.env` file with the main service ports, versions, and container names.

Review it before starting, especially if you want to change:

- Orion-LD version and exposed port
- Mintaka and TimescaleDB versions
- IoT Agent ports
- application and context service ports
- MQTT broker settings

### Start the stack

The repository includes a `docker-compose.yaml` file for the complete stack. You can directly test if by running:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
You can force local build from source using following command 

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Access the application

Once the containers are running, open:

```text
http://localhost:3002
```

### Typical workflow

1. Open the home page.
2. Enter a trial name and click **Start Trial**.
3. The application creates the trial entities and provisions the sensor.
4. Optionally enable real-time EMG updates in the UI.
5. Click **Start Anomaly detector**.
6. Click **Start CEP**.
7. When finished, click **Stop Trial**.

### What the stack is doing behind the scenes

- **Orion-LD** stores current NGSI-LD entities.
- **Mintaka + TimescaleDB** provide temporal access to historical entity data.
- **IoT Agent JSON** manages device provisioning and ingestion.
- **Mosquitto** transports MQTT messages from sensors and to the Robotic systems.
- **The Flask app** orchestrates trial creation, processing, and UI flow.

Note that the application expects the rest of the FIWARE stack (Orion-LD, IoT Agent, Mintaka, Mosquitto, context service, databases) to be available through the container network, so the full Docker Compose deployment is the recommended setup.

## 3. Related repositories and recommended resources

The application relies on the following components referenced in the archetecture and the docker-compose file:

- **Context server** - source code of the context service 
  `https://github.com/danish123117/INCODE-AtContextServer`

More information about the use of FIWARE components can be found on the following links:

## 4. Sensor info

Use case uses BTS FREEMG1000, sEMG sensors. A total of six sensor units were used. An intermediate Sensor logger app was used to publish the data
via MQTT to the follwing topic json/danishabbas1/EMG1000/attrs. Which follows the schema <payloadFormat>/<apiKey>/<sensorID>/attrs required for IoTAgent-Json.
